				<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			  </div>
              <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
				  <p>One could argue that Pittsburgh is an art city - it spends more comparatively on public art than other similarly sized cities - but no one does</p>
				  <p> The purpose of our project was to learn more about the role that public art plays in the cities identity, how people develop and hold the concepts of cities, and how tourists interact with public art to grow the role that public art plays in the cities image in order to increase the livability of Pittsburgh.</p>
				  <p>The key challenge in achieving this is that the first thing to come to any visitors minds when they think of the Pittsburgh are sports or steel, things that seem to be in conflict with public art.</p>
				</div>
			  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
				  <p>Our research insights informed our design of StarWalk, an interactive virtual tour guide app for Pittsburgh that connects iconic sights, like public art, to Pittsburgh's history and culture to show their relevance to a more complex Pittsburgh. Unlike a traditional tour guide, StarWalk allows for unstructured accessible exploration.</p><p>Ultimately, by fully highlighting the existing artwork and culture, StarWalk has the opportunity to increase the livability of the city by increasing its tourism base beyond “sportspeople”, thereby increasing tourism revenue, which gives the government money to provide services that increase livability for residents.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				  <p>Historically, public art is meant to reflect and represent the public. Each year Pittsburgh spends money on public art to showcase the rich history and culture of this city. While this multidimensionality is represented in Pittsburgh’s public art it is not represented in Pittsburgh's “sports and steel” identity.</p>
				  <p>Realizing this disconnect, with the understanding of the goal of improving the city we began this project with the goal of answering the question: How might we increase the role that public art plays in Pittsburghs Identity?</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				  <p>To answer that question, and ultimately create StarWalk. I worked with my team through many different user research methods. Conducting this research helped us to gain an understanding of how people see Pittsburgh and conceptualize cities in general, as well as how they prioritize parts of a city. Then narrow down our ideas on how to intervene and increase the role that public art plays in Pittsburgh's identity?</p>

				<h2>Pittsburgh's Identity Is disconnected from Public Art</h2>
		  </div>
			<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
				  <p>We interviewed people who had not visited Pittsburgh, across three countries, and the only answers given, in a semi-structured interview environment where they could say anything you wanted, to the question, what do you think of when you think of Pittsburgh, was: sports and/or steel. No one said public art (while they were able to do so for other cities).</p>
				  <p>Not only was the public art not readily accessible in their mental concept of Pittsburgh, but it also was not accessible on the internet.</p>
				  <img src="FirstFindingBrainstormStar.png" alt="screenshots from thinkaloud showing point" width="100%">
				  <blockquote>“I didn’t see public art as an option in Pittsburgh, when looking for art," <br>-Think Aloud </blockquote>
					<p>A think-aloud Pittsburgh trip planning activity ended with no participants selecting public art as an activity out of the 5 they planned for a theoretical Pittsburgh trip. It got passed over, because no participant was presented with public art as an opportunity on popular sites like trip advisor or in any promoted blogs.</p>
					<p>Similarly, from a usability test of the Pittsburgh visitors site, reveled that information about public art was absurdly inaccessible, as instead of being on the website it was in a linked 50-page pdf document! Comparatively, on the Chicago Visitors site (Note: Chicago was a city that participants readily associated with public art) public art was highlighted in the carousel on the main page. This divide reflects how attached it is to their image.</p><p>Ultimately, if the connection between Pittsburgh and public art is hidden in people’s minds, internet searches, as well as a website Pittsburgh’s uses to define itself, then it is safe to say that Pittsburgh's identity is currently disconnected from public art.</p>

				<p>With these four findings in mind, we explored the solution space focusing on four core concepts:&nbsp; <strong>Interactivity, Connectivity, Accessibility, and Identity</strong></p><p>We want to enhance the interactivity of public art experiences, use art as a medium to better connect visitors with the local culture. To achieve that we want to make public art more accessible so that people who are not familiar with Pittsburgh can discover its artistic side. And eventually, promote public art in the city identity to tourists and increase the livability of city.</p>

				  <p>The hope is that this app, could be roles out at a large fashion in PGH, by being advertised in online searches for things to do in Pittsburgh as-well as with physical promotion materials at the ports of entery to the city to potential tourists, and others forming an impression of the city, so that we could intervene for those willing to learn.</p>
