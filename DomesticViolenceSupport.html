                <p>Domestic violence has always been a big problem, with 1/7 men and 1/4 women experiencing it during
                    their lifetime. However, COVID-19 lockdown measures are the perfect storm for abuse as isolation
                    traps victims with abusers who are likely to be feeling an increased lack of control due to the
                    pandemic.</p>
                <p> This effect can be seen in the increased interaction with the astronomical increase in Hotlines for
                    domestic violence, across America and the world at large. While it is true that in America calls to
                    the police for domestic violence have gone down (though not as much as other crimes).</p>
                <p> This increase in support use has overwhelmed systems, with wait times increasing by 300%, just in
                    the first month of lockdown in DC and a 2000% increase in text service in IL.</p>

                <p>When one seeks support for domestic violence, they often need help immediately in a way that wonâ€™t
                    aggravate the situation further. Things that do not leave a trace, like a CUI, or can be done
                    silently like messaging can be perfect for this situation.</p>
                <p>Created at the beginning of the pandemic, utilizing the capabilities of CUI and relying upon best
                    practices for these situations established in social work literature we strived to address the
                    specific needs of people attempting to flee domestic violence situations during this time.</p>
