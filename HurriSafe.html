			<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
				<p>When hurricanes come, people need to leave, but evacuation efforts always leave people behind, they
					cannot make contact with and rescue everyone in the current system.</p>
				<p>Currently, with the climate crisis at hand, the frequency and intensity of these storms are
					increasing and in turn the need to be able to evacuate people from such conditions with ease grows.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
				<p> From outside research, interviews with crisis management personnel, and discussions with engineers,
					we created Hurrisafe, a module that tracks people by heat and creates a local network to enable
					communication from officials to those left on the ground and to enable those who are stuck to be
					tracked by their body heat.</p>
				<p>This project culminated in the explainer video, above!</p>

			<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				<p> Hurricane rescue is currently extremely inefficient, with many left behind and left confused about
					where their appropriate shelter. This can be absolutely devastating to communities. A large rout of
					this pain comes from an inability to communicate to those who need help and are providing it, as
					hurricanes take out natural power lines. With this project, we tried to figure out if there was a
					way to make Hurricane Rescue more efficient with technology.</p>

				<h1>Methods</h1>

			<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				<p> The begging of answering this question was building a foundation on the topic of Hurricanes through
					historical records, state preparedness manuals, and interviews with those in charge. From there we
					looked more into technology to learn what types of sensors we could use to make our idea work.
					Finally, we began to make our video, and present our solution, iterating through storyboards scripts
					and videos to create something that professional to explain what's happening in made the concept of
					a local area network and a shelter plan really quickly and persuasively in a very short time frame.

				<h1>Solution</h1>

			<div class="col-lg-6 col-md-8 col-sm-12">
				<p>Our solution, Hurri-Safe is a tiny module that can be dropped off of planes and will dig into the
					ground using its claes. It is heavy enough weight to support itself in Hurricanes situations after
					later blows.</p>
				<p> Once it lands, it creates a local area network which it will allow for those within the area to
					receive alerts on their phones from officials about evacuation times, and shelter directions &
					capacity updates. Additionally, the infrared sensor on the module can be used to scan the area for
					heat, which is a fairly good representation of people enabling officials to better optimize their
					rescue routes and increase the time when they can carry out rescues to include dark hours. </p>
				<p>In summary, by creating a local area network and scanning for heat HurriSafe can improve the
					efficiency and effectiveness of all important hurricane rescue missions</p>
