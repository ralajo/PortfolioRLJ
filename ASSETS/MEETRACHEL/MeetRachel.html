                <p>I'm Rachel Jones, a senior majoring in Human-Computer Interaction and Business Administration at
                    Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
                <p>Previously, I worked the a UX Designer for a startup, where I helped to transform the idea that there
                    may be a room for increased efficiency in personal training into a funded business with a design
                    that has since been developed and brought to commercial use.</p>
                <p>Last summer, I interned as a Cognitive Systems Engineer at Resilient Cognitive Solutions in
                    Pittsburgh where I used my understanding of design, cognitive psychology, and business to improve
                    complex decision support systems.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-sm-6">
                <p>When I am not designing you can find me running on the track and cross country teams.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about accessibility as I see the created digital world as an opportunity to create a
                    more inclusive society.I strive to learn and push myself every day to become a more effective and
                    innovative problem solver and help create products and services that positively impact society.</p>
